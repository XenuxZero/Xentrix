Xentrix is a clone of Tetris with some media and art from third parties, so is not
for commercial use, but it could be modified freely.

Xentrix was made to test my skills and it was coded in C# in a "classic game" way,
so it doesn't use fancy or cpu consuming capabilites like physics or collisions.

The script is fully commented and extensively explained in detail, but is in Spanish.

Thanks and enjoy!
