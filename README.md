<p>Xentrix is a clone of Tetris with some media and art from third parties, so is not
for commercial use, but it could be modified freely.</p>

<p>Xentrix was made to test my skills and it was coded in C# in a "classic game" way,
so it doesn't use fancy or cpu consuming capabilites like physics or collisions.</p>

<p>The script is fully commented and extensively explained in detail, but is in Spanish.</p>

<p>Thanks and enjoy!</p>
